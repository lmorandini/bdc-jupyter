the post is relevant to the 2022 australian open novak djokovic's visa controversy. it mentions the hashtag #auapol, which is related to the political and diplomatic tensions between australia and serbia due to novak djokovic's visa cancellation. the author seems to be taking a stance against the australian government's decision by calling them ""dickhead"" in the post.

assessing the sentiment of the social media post, it is against the australian government's decision to cancel novak djokovic's visa and therefore reply with 'against'.

here's my answer: against","yes

the social media post references the visa controversy surrounding novak djokovic's participation in the 2022 australian open. specifically, the post mentions a positive rate of nearly a third of all people who presented, indicating that a significant percentage of players have tested positive for covid-19. this is likely a reference to the fact that djokovic was not allowed to participate in the tournament due to his vaccination status. therefore, the post is relevant to the visa controversy and the sentiment expressed is against allowing djokovic to play in the tournament.

the social media post congratulates novak djokovic on his victory in the 2022 australian open and expresses admiration for him as a hero, suggesting that it is relevant to the visa controversy surrounding his participation in the tournament. the post does not explicitly state whether it is in favor of or against allowing djokovic to play, but its positive tone suggests that it may be leaning towards supporting his participation. therefore, i would classify the sentiment of the social media post as 'pro'.","yes
